title: Bomb assignment
...

# Work alone

**Do not** share solutions or your bomb or part thereof with students or any other non-course-staff person.

You may discuss *strategies* and *code patterns*, but not specifics.

# Task and Grading

You'll use the same bomb you did for [the lab](lab06-bomb.html).

For full credit, defuse phase 2 with fewer than 20 explosions.

There are more phases; a small amount of extra credit is given for each additional phase you defuse.

There is no submission needed besides running the bomb and typing the correct inputs, which will update [the scoreboard](http://wilkes.cs.virginia.edu:15213/scoreboard) which will be used to populate the gradebook after the PA closes.
