title: Computer Organization and Architecture 1
...

# Overview 

This is our first offering of a course we hope will, along with several other
courses, replace and update several of our current courses.
More information about the pilot of these courses as a whole may be found at
<http://pilot.cs.virginia.edu/>.

For the sake of conversing with those familiar with our other course offerings,
this course covers the assembly-and-C half of CS 2150 "Program and Data Representation";
the basics of ECE 2330 "Digital Logic Design";
and the first part of CS 3330 "Computer Architecture";
in addition to having several new topics we felt were under-represented in our
previous set of course offerings.

We are particularly interested in you feedback on how the course is progressing.
We invite you to address issues and bring suggestions in person,
on [Piazza](https://piazza.com/class/jg2a16chw1c7l),
and via the [anonymous feedback](https://collab.its.virginia.edu/portal/site/cc61a431-31b8-4a97-ab16-6b8a0d15d12e/tool/11913f17-191e-4da1-965b-001baf44a370/main) feature of [Collab](https://collab.its.virginia.edu/portal/site/cc61a431-31b8-4a97-ab16-6b8a0d15d12e).
