# Introduction

This will continue both your (a) implementation of a simulator and (b) coding for it
begun during [lab](lab04-simulator.html). It assumes you have understood that lab's content well.

# Simulator expansion

As with lab, edit `execute` only and access `R` and `M` in addition to local variables.

The behavior of all instructions, including those in lab, is given in the following table:

# Write a program in binary

Create a binary program (i.e., a file containing hex bytes)
that runs in this language; name the file `fib.binary`.

When run in a simulator (yours or [ours](files/toy-isa-sim.html)), `fib.binary`
should change the contents of memory for all addresses `i` ≥ C0~16~,
placing in address `i` the `i-0xC0`th Fibonacci number (modulo 256, since these are bytes).

Once `0xC0` through `0xff` are set, halt by running an instruction with the `reserved` bit set.

The file `fib.binary` itself must not contain more than C0~16~ (192~10~) hexadecimal bytes.

It should be the case that running your simulator on `fib.binary` for several hundred cycles should result in output ending with the following:


    0xc0-cf: 01 01 02 03 05 08 0d 15 22 37 59 90 e9 79 62 db
    0xd0-df: 3d 18 55 6d c2 2f f1 20 11 31 42 73 b5 28 dd 05
    0xe0-ef: e2 e7 c9 b0 79 29 a2 cb 6d 38 a5 dd 82 5f e1 40
    0xf0-ff: 21 61 82 e3 65 48 ad f5 a2 97 39 d0 09 d9 e2 bb

# Submit

Submit your simulator as either a `.java` or `.py` file (any name is fine, but submit only one java/python file) and your program and `fib.binary`.

# Hints, tips, and suggestions

## Language nuances

Python's syntax for `!x`{.c} is `not x`{.python} instead.

Java treats bytes (like `R[i]`{.java}) as signed integers, not unsigned.
That means they are not good indices (e.g., `M[R[i]]`{.java} might throw an exception if `R[i]`{.java} is negative).
However, `R[i] & 0xFF`{.java} treats it as unsigned instead,
so `M[R[i] & 0xFF]`{.java} should work.

Python treats bytes as unsigned, so `R[i] <= 0`{.python} is always true.
It can be re-written to work correctly as `R[i] == 0 or R[i] >= 0x80`{.python}

## Simulator building and testing

Try making a minimal program to test each instruction.
Typically this will involve a few (`icode`=6, `b`=0) instructions to put numbers into registers
and then the instruction you want to test.
Unless of course no registers are needed...

For example,
    
- to test instruction 7,
    
    The following should not jump, so three steps should end up with the PC at address 5, not 20:
    
    pseudocode                  parts           bytes
    --------------------------  ------------    -------------
    R~0~ = 10                   (6, 0, 0) 10    60 0A
    R~1~ = 20                   (6, 1, 0) 20    64 14
    if R~0~ <= 0, jump to R~1~  (7, 0, 1)       71

    The following should jump, so three steps should end with the PC at address 20, not 5:
        
    pseudocode                  parts           bytes
    --------------------------  ------------    -------------
    R~0~ = −10                  (6, 0, 0) −10   60 F6
    R~1~ = 20                   (6, 1, 0) 20    64 14
    if R~0~ <= 0, jump to R~1~  (7, 0, 1)       71

- to test instruction 6.3,
    
    The following should load 20 into R~1~
    
    pseudocode                  parts           bytes
    --------------------------  ------------    -------------
    R~2~ = 10                   (6, 2, 0) 10    68 0A
    R~3~ = 20                   (6, 3, 0) 20    6C 14
    write R~3~ to address R~2~  (4, 3, 2)       4E
    read address 10 into R~1~   (6, 1, 3) 10    67 0A
    
    You could also do this without using instruction 4
    by setting enough memory that there was already data in address 10:
    
    pseudocode                      parts           bytes
    ----------------------------    ------------    ------------------------
    read address 10 into R~1~       (6, 1, 3) 10    67 0A
    intialize address 10 with 20    0s, then 20     00 00 00 00 00 00 00 14
    
    
Etc.

A few examples:

icode = 0
:   First load a value into R~1~ then set R~2~ to equal R~1~: `64 14` `09`

icode = 1
:   First load a value into R~1~ and R~2~ then add them together: `64 14` `68 20` `19`

icode = 2
:   First load a value into R~1~ and R~2~ then and them together: `64 14` `68 20` `29`

icode = 3
:   First load a value into R~1~ and then load that memory address into R~2~: `64 02` `39`

icode = 4
:   First load a value into R~1~ and R~2~ and then store R~1~ into memory at R~2~: `64 02` `68 20` `46`

icode = 5
:   First load a value into R~1~ and then do something to it: 
    
    - flip all bits: `64 89` `54` (result: `76`)
    - perform `!`: `64 89` `55` (result: `00`; try also `55` by itself to result in `01`)
    - negate: `64 89` `56` (result: `77`)
    - replace with the PC: `64 89` `57`  (result: `02`)

icode = 6
:   First load a value into R~1~ and then use an immediate: 

    - replace with immediate: `64 14` `64 20` (result: `20`)
    - add immediate: `64 14` `65 20` (result: `34`)
    - and immediate: `64 14` `66 24` (result: `04`)
    - replace with memory contents at immediate: `64 14` `67 02` (result: `67`)

icode = 7
:   First load an address into R~1~, a value into R~2~, and then conditionally jump: 

    - jumps: `64 14` `68 ff` `79`
    - jumps: `64 14` `68 80` `79`
    - jumps: `64 14` `68 00` `79`
    - does not jump: `64 14` `68 01` `79`
    - does not jump: `64 14` `68 7f` `79`


## Binary programming

You may use [our visual simulator](files/toy-isa-sim.html) if you are unsure of the quality of your own. It lets you manually edit memory or upload memory files, and uses green highlights to show what was read, orange to show what was written.

We suggest following these steps, carefully, saving the result of each in a file so you can go back and fix them if they were wrong:

1. Write pseudocode that does the desired task
2. Convert any `for` loops to `while` loops with explicit counters
3. Change any `if` or `while` guards to the form `something <= 0`
    - `a <= b` becomes `a-b <= 0`
    - `a < b` becomes `a+1 <= b` becomes `a+1-b <= 0`
    - `a >= b` becomes `0 >= b-a` becomes `b-a <= 0`
    - `a > b` becomes `0 > b-a` becomes `b+1-a <= 0`
    - `a == b` becomes `a-b == 0` becomes `!(a-b) == 1` becomes `!!(a-b) <= 0`
    - `a != b` becomes `a-b != 0` becomes `!(a-b) == 0` becomes `!(a-b) <= 0`
4. Add more variables to split multi-operation lines into a series of single-operation lines
5. Add more operations to convert ones not in the instruction set into ones in the instruction set
6. Change each loop into a pair of instructions, opening with "`spot1` = `pc`" and closing with "if ..., goto `spot1`"
7. Count the number of variables needed
    - If^[depending on how you write your original code, this is possible for this task …] it is ≤ 4, skip to step 10
    - else^[… but most solutions are in this case instead.], continue with next step
8. Pick a memory address for each variable. Make these big enough your cod is unlikely to get that big; for example, you might pick `0x80` though `0x80` + number of variables
9. Convert each statement that uses variables into
    a. register ← load variable's memory
    b. original statement
    c. store variable's memory ← register
10. translate each instruction into numeric (`icode`, `a`, `b`) triples, possibly followed by a `M[pc+1]` immediate value
11. turn (`icode`, `a`, `b`) into hex
12. Write all the hex into `fib.binary`

Debugging binary is hard. That's part of why we don't generally write code in binary. If you get stuck, you should probably try pulling just the part you are stuck on separate from the rest and test it until it works, then put it back in the main solution.
