title: Shell Lab
...

The purpose of this lab is to get you familiar with the most important aspects of the command line environment,
sometimes called the shell, sh, bash, or the terminal.

# Install NX Client

(awaiting instructions from systems staff)

# Open a terminal

(add instructions that work)

# Basic commands

The main interactions you have in a terminal consist of directories, files, and commands.

## Commands

You type commands.
First comes the name of the command, and then optionally an number of arguments to it.
Commands are kind of like functions, but the syntax is different: spaces are used instead of parentheses and commas.

One of the commands is called `echo`.
It is sort of like a `print` in Python or a `println` in Java.
For example, if you type

````sh
echo This is my first command
````

you should see a line displayed,

````
This is my first command
````

## Directories

Directories are like rooms.
