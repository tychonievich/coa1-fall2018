# Addressing modes

Operands of most operations may be either a register, an immediate value, or the contents of memory.
A memory address in general is made of an immediate, two registers, and a scale on one of the registers:
`imm + rA + rB*s` where `s` is one of the four specific values `1`, `2`, `4`, or `8`.

# Two syntaxes

For mostly historical reasons, x86-64 has two different syntaxes.

Feature         Intel syntax        AT&T syntax
-----------     ------------------- -----------------------------
Register        `rsp`               `%rsp`
Immediate       `23`                `$23`
Reg+Imm Addr    `[rsp+23]`          `23(rsp)`
R+R*4+Imm Addr  `[rsp+r8*4+23]`     `23(rsp,r8,4)`
`a += b`        `add rax,rbx`       `addq %rbx, %rax`

In general, AT&T syntax is more explicit: there are prefixes for types,
operations have width suffixes, etc.
Intel syntax, on the other hand, is more loose, 
and has to add things like `QWORD PTR` if the instructions operands do not make the width of a command obvious.

Intel syntax                    AT&T syntax
------------------------------- -----------------------------
`call QWORD PTR [r12+rbx*8]`    `callq *(%r12,%rbx,8)`

The width specifiers are

bits   historical name                                         Intel name  AT&T Suffix register names     
------- ------------------------------------------------------- ----------- ----------- ----------------------
8       byte                                                    BYTE        b           ah, al, r9b, ...
16      word, as this was the native size of the 8086 processor WORD        w           ax, r9w, ...
32      double word                                             DWORD       *no suffix* eax, r9d, ...

The most popular \*nix toolchains default to AT&T syntax.
The most popular Windows toolchains default to Intel syntax.

# Registers

The general-purpose program registers in x86-64 have somewhat ideosyncratic names:

Register number 8-bit   16-bit  32-bit  64-bit  notes
--------------- ------- ------- ------- ------- --------------------------------
0               ah, al  ax      eax     rax     special meaning for multiply and divide instructions; often used to store return values
1               ch, cl  cx      ecx     rcx
2               dh, dl  dx      edx     rdx     special meaning for multiply and divide instructions
3               
4
5
6
7
8               r8b     r8w     r8d     r8
9               r9b     r9w     r9d     r9
10              r10b    r10w    r10d    r10
11              r11b    r11w    r11d    r11
12              r12b    r12w    r12d    r12
13              r13b    r13w    r13d    r13
14              r14b    r14w    r14d    r14
15              r15b    r15w    r15d    r15

^[note: look up order of rbx, rbp, rsp, rdi, and rsi]

The registers overlap in the low-order bits.
Thus, if r15 is `0x0123456789abcedf` then 
r15d is `0x89abcdef`,
r15w is `0xcdef`,
and r15b is `0xef`.
When there are two 8-bit registers in the same cell above, the "h" register is the high-order byte of the 16-bit register, so
if rax is `0x0123456789abcedf` then 
eax is `0x89abcdef`,
ax is `0xcdef`,
al is `0xef`,
and ah is `0xcd`.

In part because x86-64 has preserved backwards compatibility with many previous architectures
all the way back to the 16-bit integer-only 8086,
many newer operations have been placed in their own register bank with their own operations.
As one of the larger examples, floating-point operations are not handled from the main registers.
However, we'll restrict ourselves to the registers above and the operations that work on them.

# The most important instructions

x86-64 has thousands of instructions, but many of them are used only in fairly specialized cases.
The following instructions are the most important to understand x86-64 code.

Move
:   The various `mov` instructions implement, in effect, the assignment operator `=`.
    Moves can be done between registers, memory, and immediates, with some limitations;
    as a rule of thumb, either the source or destination must be a register.
    
    When moving from a smaller source to a larger destination, `mov` has two variants:
    `movzx` (**z**ero-e**x**tend) fills in the extra high-order bits with zeros,
    and `movsx` (**s**ign-e**x**tend) fills in the extra high-order bits with copies of the high-order bit of the source.
    
    There are special moves for moving between register banks (as, e.g., moves to and from the XMM registers, etc).
    
    There are also *conditional* moves which only moves if the condition codes indicate the last compared value had a particular relationship to 0, although those are fairly uncommon in compiled code.

Jumps
:   Jumps move the `pc` to a new location.
    `jmp` does this unconditionally,
    and various other instructions do so conditionally.
    Conditions in x86-64 are based on the "condition codes", a set of single-bit flags
    that store enough information to compare a value to 0.
    Condition codes are set by most ALU operations, as well as by the special `cmp` and `test` operations.
    
    Because comparisons are done differently for signed and unsigned values,
    there are multiple versions of comparions:
    
    `je`, `jne`
    :   Jump if the compared values were equal (`je`) or not equal (`jne`)
        or the result of the last operations was equal to 0 (`je`) or not (`jne`)
    
    `ja`, `jae`, `jb`, `jbe`
    :   Jump if the first compared values were above/below the other, using unsigned comparisons.
    
    `jg`, `jge`, `jl`, `jle`
    :   Jump if the first compared values were greater/lesser that the other, using signed comparisons.
    
    There are also conditional jumps that check just single bits of the conditions codes, one of moderate commonness being `js` which checks the sign bit.
    
Load Effective Address
:   One specific instruction, `lea`, is widely used.
    It looks like a memory-to-register move, but instead of loading the contents of memory at an address
    it loads the address itself.
    
    Because addresses are computed by adding two registers and an immediate, with one address being multiplied by a small power-of-two constant, `lea` is commonly used to perform basic arithmetic.
    For example, code like `a = 5*b + 20` can be written in AT&T syntax x86-64 as `lea 20(rbx,rbx,4),%rax`.

ALU operations
:   Most ALU operations are implemented in x86-64 as assignment operators in code.

    Instruction     Is like
    --------------  ---------------
    `add`           `+=`
    `sub`           `-=`
    `and`           `&=`
    `or`            `|=`
    `xor`           `^=`
    `shl`           `<<=`
    `shr`           `>>=`, zero-extending
    `sar`           `>>=`, sign-extending
    
    These instructions also set the condition codes.
    Additionally, `cmp` sets the condition codes like `sub`, and `test` like `and`, but both without storing the result in a register.
    
    Multiplication and division are implemented differently.
    The result of addition can be one bit larger than its largest operand,
    which makes `+=` a relatively safe way to handle it;
    but multiplication can result in twice as many bits as the largest operand,
    and the circuitry that does division also does modulus as the same time,
    meaning both effectively have multiple registers of return value(s).

Push and pop
:   The behavior of `push X` can be described as

        rsp -= 8
        memory[rsp] = X
    
    The behavior of `pop X` can be described as
    
        X = memory[rsp]
        rsp += 8
    
    Note that some programs use only 32-bit and smaller values,
    and use a variant of `push` and `pop` that adjust `esp` by 4 instead of `rsp` by 8.
    
    Push and pop are widely used in common function call protocols,
    for argument passing and register saving,
    as will be explained later.

Call and return
:   `call X` means "push the address of the next instruction, then `jmp X`.
    `ret` means `pop PC` -- an instruction not otherwise writeable using `pop`
    because `PC` is not a program register.

# Calling Conventions

Although not intrinsically dictated by the ISA itself,
it is common for ISAs to be accompanied by a recommended calling convention.
This involves three primary components:

Argument passing
:   Invoking a function (with `call`) involves jumping to its code and storing where to return to.
    That code needs to know where to find it's arguments.
    
    x86-64's most common calling convention puts the arguments, in order, in 
    rdx, rcx, rdi, rsi, r8, and r9.
    Remaining arguments, if any, are pushed onto the stack, last to first, before the `call`.

Return value passing
:   The code that invokes a function needs to know from where to retrieve it's return value.
    x86-64's most common calling convention puts the return value into rax.

Callee- and caller-save registers
:   In general, both the code that invokes a function and the code of the function itself
    will use all the program registers.
    This means that the old values of these registers must be saved and restored.
    
    x86-64 calling conventions distinguish between callee-save and caller-save registers.
    
    A callee-save register is one that the invoking code must assume the invoked code might have changed,
    thus necessitating saving it before the call if it contains meaningful data to the invoking code.
    It is also one that the invoked code can use without first saving and later restoring.
    
    A caller-save register is one that the invoking code can assume the invoked code will not change,
    and thus the invoking code does not need to save before the call.
    It is also one that the invoked code cannot use unless it first saves its value
    and restores that saved value to the register before returning.
    
    The most common way to save a register is to push its contents onto the stack using `push` (as, e.g., `push %rax`)
    or a similar `rsp`-based `mov` (as, e.g., `mov %rax,-32(rsp)`).
    
    x86-64's most common calling convention identifies
    ...
    as callee-save registers and
    ...
    as caller-save.

Note that all of the above is merely convention.
A program could violate all of these rules and still work fine,
but it might have some difficulty interacting with other functions if it does.
In that way it is similar to conventions about what side of the street to drive on
or what color of traffic signal light means "stop":
the decision is fairly arbitrary, but if you make a different arbitrary decision than others do
then things are not likely to go well for you.
