title: Socket Chat
...

In this assignment, you'll take the server code we supplied and the client code you wrote in [lab 9](lab09-sockets.html) and combine them to make a command-line 2-party chat program.

# Requirements

Write a single file called `schat.c`. Use only C library functions and code you wrote in it: no third-party libraries or C++.

`schat.c` should have a `main` function that accepts command-line arguments.
If given no arguments, it should run in server mode; if given two arguments (the first an IP address, the second a port number) it should run in client mode, connecting to that server.

The server should begin by

1. Pick a random ephemeral-range port, like the lab server code did
1. Display that port number to the terminal, like the lab server code did
1. Listen for IPv4 connections on any IP address, like the lab server code did
1. `accept` only once, unlike the lab server's `accept` loop
1. `close` the `listen`er socket before working with the `accept`ed socket

The client should begin by

1. `connect`ing to the given IP address and port, like you lab client did

Both should then proceed as follows:

1. Repeatedly (i.e., in an infinite loop) use `poll`^[see `man poll`{.bash} which has some example code in it.] to pick either the connected socket (from the server's `accept` or the client's `connect`) or the standard input stream^[which is always already open as file descriptor `0`] to `read`^[Note: this means you'll need to use `POLLIN` as the `fds[i].events` instead of the `POLLOUT | POLLWRBAND` used in the manual page example.] from. Use a 1-minute^[60 thousand milliseconds] timeout for `poll`.
1. If `poll` returns a positive number (i.e., it succeeded),
    1. If the standard input has `revents` including `POLLIN`, `read` from standard input and `write` what you read to the socket.
    1. If the socket has `revents` including `POLLIN`, `read` from the socket and `write` what you read to standard output^[which is always already open with file descriptor `1`]. You may assume no single message is more than 4096 bytes, to avoid needing to loop your `read`/`write` calls.

# Undefined behaviors

This assignment does not require you to handle the following in any particular way:

1. Giving notice of server IP address
1. Failure of any of the socket, read, or write instructions
1. Handling the closing of the remote connection
1. Stopping if the `poll` call times out
1. Having any way to end the program other than Ctrl+C
1. Avoiding memory leaks
1. Clean display when the remote message arrives while the user it typing
1. Displaying who sent which message

You *do* need to avoid buffer overflows, use-after-free, and other memory bugs.
You are also *invited* to add sane behaviors for all of the above cases, but are not *required* to do so.

# Example

In a simple implementation, once the client and server connect everything that is typed in one will appear in the other after you press enter.

<table width="100%"><thead><tr><th width="50%">Server</th><th width="50%">Client</th></thead><tbody><tr><td style="vertical-align:top"><pre id="server" style="color:white;background:black;padding:2ex;">$ </pre></td><td style="vertical-align:top"><pre id="client" style="color:white;background:black;padding:2ex;">$ </pre></td></tr></tbody><table>

document.getElementById('client').innerHTML = '$ ';
document.getElementById('server').innerHTML = '$ ';
i = 0;

setTimeout(act, 1000);
} else {
let row = events[i];
let dest = document.getElementById(row[0] == 'c'? 'client':'server');
if (row[1] == 'p') {
dest.innerHTML = dest.innerHTML + row.substr(2);
i += 1
ai = 2;
setTimeout(act, 500);
} else {
dest.innerHTML = dest.innerHTML + row[ai];
ai += 1;
if (ai < row.length) setTimeout(act, 100);
else { i += 1; ai = 2; setTimeout(act, 250); }
}
}
}
act();

# Tips

## Testing on a non-server

The CS department servers (the `labsrv##` your connect to through `nxfront`, the `portal##` you connect to through `ssh mst3k@portal.cs.virginia.edu`, etc) all have *static IP Addresses* meaning tools like `host` can learn who they are. Your laptop probably does not.

If your laptop has a C compiler and `poll`, `socket`, etc., implemented, you can still test locally but you'll need to use the IP address `127.0.0.1` which always means "talk to myself", running the server and client in two different terminal windows at the same time.

## Use `lldb`

When you get a segfault, you should

1. recompile with `clang -g schat.c`
2. load in a debugger with `lldb a.out`
3. `run` and see the line of code that segfaulted

This will be far easier than trying to locate the segfault without a debugger.

You may also find a debugger useful for other kinds of errors.

## Feedback

We do not currently have plans to offer automated feedback on your code when you submit. We're also not planning on testing strange cases: if you can carry on a chat conversation with someone else, where either one of you can type several things in a row and it works, you should be good to go.
